# Silent Failure in Express.js Async Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications: silent failure due to unhandled asynchronous errors.  The server doesn't respond to client requests when an error occurs within an asynchronous operation. This makes debugging and identifying issues challenging.

## The Problem
The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application with an asynchronous operation that might fail.  The error handling only logs the error to the console; it doesn't send any response to the client, resulting in a silent failure.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to this problem by properly handling errors in the asynchronous operation and returning an appropriate error response to the client using Express.js's error handling middleware. 

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Make a request to `http://localhost:3000/`.  Observe that sometimes the request will hang without a response, and other times it will work correctly. The server will only log the error to the console. 
5. Repeat steps 3 & 4 with `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected behavior.
